# GitHub Users Analysis in Paris

- To gather the data for this analysis, I utilized the GitHub API to extract user profiles and their public repositories. I filtered for users located in Paris with at least 200 followers, ensuring a relevant dataset for meaningful insights. The gathered information was stored in CSV format for further analysis.
- One of the most striking findings was the dominance of JavaScript as the preferred programming language among the analyzed developers. This highlights a potential trend in the job market and user interest, indicating that projects developed using JavaScript may have higher visibility and engagement.
- Based on the analysis results, developers are encouraged to incorporate more collaborative features in their projects, such as enhanced project management tools and community engagement options. This could not only improve their repository's popularity but also lead to a greater follower count and overall project success.
